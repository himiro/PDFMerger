## Dataset

The images are from the PASCAL VOC dataset from 2012.

Please refer to this link : http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/

The dataset is composed of two elements :
- Image ID
- Labels

The labels are the angle (in degrees) used to rotate the images. They are human labelled (108 labels) or labelled with a semi-supervised model (0 for now)
